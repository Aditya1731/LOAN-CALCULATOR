A simple Java-based loan calculator that calculates the total outstanding amount and monthly EMI based on user input. The program takes three inputs:
Principal Amount (Loan amount)
Rate of Interest (Annual interest rate)
Loan Tenure (Duration of the loan in months)
The calculator then computes the total interest, total outstanding amount (principal + interest), and the EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) for the given loan details. The program uses simple interest to calculate the interest over the loan tenure.
